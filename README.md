# NYC Citibike Casestudy

The purpose of the Citibike analysis was to look at the data for bikesharing in NYC to build a proposal for a similar business in Des Moines. Key visualizations for the final Tableau presentation included:
- Showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

The final presentation can be viewed on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leighanna.stone.bradley/viz/NYCCitibikesChallenge_16634625449410/CitibikeChallengeStory?publish=yes

## Results

The top starting and ending locations for NYC Citibike trips were highlighted using larger purple leaning circles on maps of the city. These are likely areas with a higher concentration of tourists renting bikes to get around the city.

August was used to pull a months view of peak hours for bike rentals. Trips were highest from 8am-7pm.  This breakdown also shows when the best time to complete any necessary bike maintenance would be to not disrupt business- 12am-6am.

A quick breakdown of users reported gender showed the majority of users were male.

The trip duration for each bike was documented and bikes with more use that will likely need the most maintenance are highlighted in larger, purple leaning circles.

The length of time the bikes were checked out for trips was broken out into hours and minutes.

The trip lengths were then further broken our by gender.

The number of trips per hour for each day of the week were documented.

The number of trips per hour for each weekday were then further broken out by gender.

The trips for customers vs subscribers were broken out by weekday and gender to view the trip volume.

## Summary

- In total it was found there were 2,344,224 Citibike trips in NYC. 
- The majority of the users were found to be male. 
- On average the highest volume of trips were weekdays 8am-9am and 5pm-7pm which aligns with typical times people may be commuting to work.

For future analysis, it would be beneficial to look at the gender breakdown of the different areas in NYC to see if the areas with higher volume have a higher male population as the majority of users are identifying as male. There may be other areas of the city (or areas of Des Moines) with a high male population to focus on building business. It would also be beneficial to look into whether users are locals or tourists. The peak hours align with commuting hours which may indicate the initial assumption that areas with higher volume had a higher tourist count. This will also be important for the Des Moines proposal- Does Des Moines have a high number of tourists? The business may be more successful if locals are the ones utilizing the bikesharing bikes.
